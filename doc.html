		<h2>Implementation</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><h3>Frontend</h3></li>
			<p>
				The creation of fronted was based on initially created wireframes, laying the guidelines for successful implementation of user friendly information system.<br>
				The main goal of the design was to create simple and easy to navigate system. It was necessary to let user to focus on actual purpose of the system, instead of getting lost in the interface while looking for desired functionalities.<br>

			<p>
				The implementation of frontend was done is a progressive Javascript framework <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.JS</a> for building user interfaces. A supporting components library <a href="https://vuesax.com/">Vuesax</a> was used as well.
				<br>
				<br>
				<a href="https://router.vuejs.org/">Official Vue.JS router</a> was used to route between system components in a Single Page App manner. Routing is handled in <b>frontend/src/router/router.js</b>.
				<br>
				<br>
				To communicate with our API, service for each logical unit was created. This endpoints querying can be found in <b>frontend/src/services/</b>.
				<br>
				<br>
				To handle current user information as well as tokens for authentication, <a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/">Vuesax</a> - centralized store for all the components was used. Source file can be found in <b>frontend/src/store/</b>.
				<br>
				<br>
				Views are modeling all use cases from your use case diagram modelled according to the requirements. All views are located in <b>frontend/src/views/</b> and structured in folders according to user roles.
				<br>
				For each user role, several subfolders were created, each containing Vue files modeling specific use case. For example module for creation of new patient is located in <b>frontend/src/views/admin/newUserModules/</b>.

		<h2>Installation</h2>
		<h1><b>TODO Petr</b></h1>
		Stručne popište:
		<ul>
		<li>postup instalace na server,</li>
		<li>softwarové požadavky (verze PHP apod.),</li>
		<li>jak rozbalit, konfigurovat, inicializovat databázi, ...</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Acknowledged issues</h2>
		<p>Every use case and feature required by the assignment was implemented. <br>
			The implementation of the manipulation with assigned tickets was implemented contrary to the assignment. We do not consider this an issue.
			The assignment states that doctor who was assigned with ticket is not supposed to see the record of the entire health concern. In our opinion, it is necessary to let him see all the previous measures and examinations
			that were performed on behalf of the given medical problem. It is important for him to be able to compare the previous and current treatment, in order to decide whether the provided treatments are sufficient. </p>
