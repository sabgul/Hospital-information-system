<h2>Implementation</h2>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Frontend</h3></li>
    <p>
        The creation of fronted was based on initially created wireframes, laying the guidelines for successful
        implementation of user-friendly information system.<br>
        The main goal of the design was to create a simple and easy way to navigate the system. It was necessary to let
        user
        focus on their task, instead of getting lost in the interface while looking for desired functionalities.<br>
        <img src="doc_assets/wireframe_2.jpg" alt="Wireframe 1" width="600">
        <img src="doc_assets/wireframe_1.jpg" alt="Wireframe 2" width="600">
    </p>
    <p>
        The implementation of frontend was done in a progressive Javascript framework <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.JS</a>
        for building user interfaces. A supporting components library <a href="https://vuesax.com/">Vuesax</a> was used
        as well.
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://router.vuejs.org/">Official Vue.JS router</a> was used to route between system components in a
        Single Page App manner. Routing is handled in <b>frontend/src/router/router.js</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        To communicate with our API, service for each logical unit was created. Querying of these endpoints can be found
        in
        <b>frontend/src/services/</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        To handle current user information as well as tokens for authentication, <a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/">Vuesax</a>
        - centralized store for all the components was used. The source file can be found in <b>frontend/src/store/</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        The views model all the required use cases and they fulfil all the requirements. All views
        are located in <b>frontend/src/views/</b> and structured in folders according to user roles.
        <br>
        For each user role, several subfolders were created, each containing Vue files modelling a specific use case.
        For
        example module for creation of new patient is located in <b>frontend/src/views/admin/newUserModules/</b>.

    </p>
    <li><h3>Backend</h3></li>

    The backend layer uses the Django framework for Python. <br>
    It handles API requests from the frontend, potentially allowing for multiple frontend implementations (such as a
    mobile app). <br>
    The API handles requests based on currently logged user and the permissions based on their roles. (e. g. A doctor
    can only access their patient's data) <br>
    The backend layer fetches data from a MySQL database.
    For uploading user media files, an Amazon S3 storage server is used. <br>
    User authentication uses JWT tokens.

    <li><h3>Database system</h3></li>
    <p>
        Scheme of implemented relational database: <br><br>
        <img src="doc_assets/hospisdb.png" alt="Hospitalis database" width="100%">
    </p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    The system was developed on machines running Ubuntu Linux and macOS. The installation script is targetted at the
    Ubuntu Linux platform.
    <ul>
        <li>Software requirements and installation</li>
        <br>
        All requirements are satisfied by running the run.sh file.
        In case of compatibility issues, look for alternatives of these packages:
        System-wide packages: python3.8 mysql-server mysql npm
        Python pip packages: (see backend/requirements.txt or backend/Pipfile)
        NPM packages: (see frontend/package.json)
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Database preparation</li>
        <br>
        If the user wishes to use a local MySQL server, they must install it themself. User should sync the connection
        names of the database user and the database with the backend/mysql_config_local.cnf.

        A Heroku hosted database can be also used. To do so, swap out the DATABASES.default.read_default_file entry in
        settings.py for the Heroku hosted database connection.

        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Installation process</li>
        <br>
        Install and setup the database before running the run.sh script.
        <br>
    </ul>

    <h2>Acknowledged issues</h2>
    <p>Every use case and feature required by the assignment has been implemented.
        The implementation of the manipulation with assigned tickets was implemented contrary to the assignment. We do
        not consider this an issue. <br>
        The assignment states that doctor who was assigned with ticket is not supposed to see the record of the entire
        health concern. In our opinion, it is necessary to let him see all the previous measures and examinations <br>
        that were performed on behalf of the given medical problem. It is important for him to be able to compare the
        previous and current treatment, in order to decide whether the provided treatments are sufficient. </p>
